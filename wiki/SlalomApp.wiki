_Screen shot from Timing Screen - Pick List for Entry to be placed in start block_

Normally the Starting block is automatically propagated from the race's start list once a racer in the starting block starts.  This picklist allows for starting racers out of order without DNSing them.  This is useful in Division 3 and 4 races where it is not critical if racers start in order.
