==Sample Screen Shots==

===Race Configuration===

http://tcay.com/SlalomApp/SlalomAppConfigurationScreen.png

The *Race Configuration* screen has typical information about a race, Name, Date, Location and total number of gates. It also has course configuration information about sections which is used to allocate gates to a section so that *Section Judges* are able to score only the gates assigned to them.   *Upstream Gates* are selected in order to give the penalty result screens UI proper gate icons.

*Advanced Options* are those used either for demo purposes or for top tier races.  They are  described with _tool tips_ popups when the user _hovers_ over the control.

===Timing===

_Screen shot from Timing Screen_


The timing screen is divided into 3 sections plus a status bar at the bottom:
  * *Start List* - which has a picklist of all the entries that have not yet started the run.  The first boat on the  start list that has not yet started is automatically _promoted_ to the Starting Block.  This can be overridden by choosing from the *Pick List Combo Box* and pressing the *Select Racer* button 

  * *Starting Block* has only 2 controls, *Start* button that starts the clock for the racer leaving the *Starting Block* and the *DNS* button indicating the racer Did Not Start (will not start this run).

  * *Finish Line* handles 3 racers simultaneously on the course and has 2 controls for each boat that has not yet crossed the finish, *Finish* which stops the clock for that associated boat, and *DNF* indicating the boat Did Not Finish. These buttons do not show for a boat once they have finished or DNF.ed.

  * *Status Bar* shows : 
    * IP address of the computer/device
    * Which run number is currently taking place 
    * Indicators for *Section Judging* stations that are currently communicating via the network
    * An indicator for electronic timing equipment status (Tag Heuer CP 5xx series is currently supported)

Normally the Starting block is automatically propagated from the race's start list once a racer in the starting block starts.  This picklist allows for starting racers out of order without DNSing them.  This is useful in Division 3 and 4 races where it is not critical if racers start in order.

===Gate Judging===

_Screen shot from Section Judging Screen_

*Section Judge* screen is designed to be used on-station at the section, but can also be used from a central *Race Control* station.  In the latter case each section can have a window to allow selecting of penalties as they are called in (sometime out of sequence), or all sections can be scored at once in a single window. The former method makes it easier to track when all gates have scored for a boat. 

With the Advanced Option for *Use ICF Penalties* is enabled, penalties will be marked with appropriate codes for 50s and diagrams for touches *TBD - WIP*.  See the Letter in parenthesis next to the 50.  This is selected from [SlalomApp#ICF_Missed_Gate_Codes *ICF Missed Gate Codes*].

The picklist shows Boats that have already been scored from the section with a red background, and those that remain to be scored with a green background.  The boat selection list will default to the first boat in the section that has not been scored.
